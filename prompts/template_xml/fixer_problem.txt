Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
{CODE_TO_BE_FIXED}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
{ERROR_MESSAGES}
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider possible solutions for the issues listed above.
2. Choose a solution that can maximize fuzzing result, which is fully utilizing the function under test and feeding it non-null input.
3. Apply the solutions to the original code.
Make sure you include {FUNC_SIG} in your solution.
The function can be included with {LINKING_HINT}
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
