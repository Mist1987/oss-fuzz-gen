Given the following C++ fuzz harness and its build error message, fix the code to make it build for fuzzing.

If there is undeclared identifier or unknown type name error, fix it by finding and including the related libraries instead.
Do not define the function or type, it defeats the purpose of fuzzing the original code.

Note that some code may need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C"</code> as their source is C program.
